# Single page - display Github user details and gists(Vue.js/jQuery)

## Description

This project contains a single web page that display some info about a Github user. The code is based on Vue.js, but I also used a little bit of jQuery, javaScript and of course, HTML/CSS. The frontend was done using bootstrap, responsive, optimized for all devices.

This is a test purpose project, it can be optimized or you can add new functionality :)
